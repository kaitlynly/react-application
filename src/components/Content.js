        A proud hare laughed at a slow tortoise and challenged him to a race.
        Confident in his speed, the hare ran far ahead and decided to take a nap.

        The tortoise kept walking slowly but steadily. While the hare slept,
        the tortoise moved closer and closer to the finish line.

        When the hare woke up, it was too late. The tortoise had already won
        the race through patience and persistence.
